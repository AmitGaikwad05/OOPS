The LinkedList class is almost identical to the ArrayList

The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class

How the ArrayList works
The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

How the LinkedList works
The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

IMP : WHEN TO USE WHICH

Use ArrayList when:
* Fast and random access of any element
* When size of the list in known or stable and dont change frequently
* When we need to add or remove elements at and from  the end respectively
* Takes less memory 

Use LinkedList when:
* Need frequent addition/removal of elements from the list
* Need to add or remove the elements at the start/middle/end of the list
* Takes more memory
