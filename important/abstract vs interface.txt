 Both abstract classes and interfaces are used to define contracts for classes. They serve similar purposes but have some differences in their usage:

Abstract class :
 1. Abstract class cannot  be instantiated (meaning, we cannot create the object of the abstract class directly, for that we have to inherit that class). 
 2. It can contain both concrete methods(normal methods) & abstract methods(method without implementation/body)
 3. Use of abstract class : can be use when we want to have a common method implementation and also an abstract method to used as per the sub class demand
 4. Use abstract classes when you want to provide a common base class for multiple related classes.

 Interface :
 1. As abstract class can contain both non implemented method and implemented methods, interface contains only non-implemented methods.
 2. All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract (IMP)
 3. Since Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods with implementations.
 4. Use interface when you want to set methods that are common and manditory to implemented class. then define those methods in their respective class.
