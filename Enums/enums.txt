------------ Enums -------------
Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants

Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed".

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma. 

NOTE :  The constants should be in uppercase letters:

enums is a special class that holds constants (words to be used)

enum is used when we have values that are not going to change like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.

enum constants are public, static and final (unchangeable - cannot be overridden)

Enums are often used in switch statements to check for corresponding values
